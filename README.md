Files in this repository consist of data collected in the Tanana Valley to assess the singular and interactive effects of drought stress and aspen leaf miner herbivory on aspen growth. The basis of the data come from tree-ring analysis (.rwl file). The other files are data derived from trees, plots, or downscaled climate data (SPEI and ClimateNA). The POTR_file_guide contains column descriptions of each file in the repository.
